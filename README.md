### URL Shortener ###

Our web-application shortens long URLs. On the main page you can provide your long URL and get a short redirection URL back. If you create an Account, you can save your URLs, delete and modify them.
We will be using the bit.ly API to shorten the URLs: https://dev.bitly.com/

As an extra feature, you can create a qr-code of your short URLs, using the following API: https://rapidapi.com/ajith/api/qr-code-generator-with-multiple-datatypes-/

Depending on the scope, this web-application can be extended with a choice of different services, e.g. tinyurl, cuttly, etc.
